# Objective  

Implement Quixo AI Agents, employing Min-Max, MinMax with Alpha-Beta pruning, Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Monte-Carlo approach, and RL with Monte-Carlo and parallelization. Test these agents against a random opponent and witness the application of computational intelligence strategies studied during the course.
